# lc-3b-sim
Simulating a microarchitecture that satisfies the LC-3b ISA specification

The goal for this project is to learn how CPU microarchitecture while abstracting away transistor/latch/flip flop/logic gate design.

  - [x] Memory
  - [x] Special registers
  - [x] Bit shifter
  - [x] Multiplexers
